# Effects of Systems in Schools

This repository contains a comparative analysis of different machine learning models (Linear Regression, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Networks) for predicting student performance. The project explores two different datasets, preprocesses the data, and evaluates the models based on metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2). Feature importance is also analyzed for the Linear Regression and XGBoost models.
